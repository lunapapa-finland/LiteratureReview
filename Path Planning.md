Certainly! Path planning for UAV obstacle avoidance can utilize various techniques beyond Reinforcement Learning (RL). Machine Learning (ML) is indeed a versatile approach that can be applied to this problem. Here's a brief overview of some alternative methods for path planning in UAV obstacle avoidance, along with relevant literature:

1. **Classical Path Planning Algorithms**:
   - **A* Algorithm**: A search algorithm widely used for pathfinding and navigation in graphs. It can be adapted to plan paths for UAVs to navigate around obstacles.
   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Another popular algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph, applicable to UAV path planning.

   **Literature**:

2. **Potential Field Methods**:
   - These methods model the UAV's surroundings as a potential field, where attractive forces guide the UAV towards the goal while repulsive forces push it away from obstacles.

3. **Evolutionary Algorithms**:
   - Genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, and other evolutionary computation techniques can be used to search for optimal or near-optimal paths through the evolutionary process.

   **Literature**:

4. **Neural Network-Based Methods**:
   - Neural networks, including deep learning architectures, can learn to predict obstacle locations and plan paths accordingly. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and other architectures have been applied to this task.

   **Literature**:
   - Chen, C. L. P., & Schmidt, D. (1992). Obstacle avoidance using neural networks. *IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics*, 39(6), 521-530.

5. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**:
   - As mentioned earlier, RL algorithms learn optimal or sub-optimal policies through interaction with the environment, making them suitable for path planning in UAV obstacle avoidance.

   **Literature**:
   - Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A. A., Veness, J., Bellemare, M. G., ... & Petersen, S. (2015). Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning. *Nature*, 518(7540), 529-533.

6. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:
   - GANs can be used to generate realistic obstacle configurations, which can then be used to train path planning algorithms or augment training data for ML models.

   **Literature**:
   - Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., ... & Bengio, Y. (2014). Generative adversarial nets. In *Advances in neural information processing systems* (pp. 2672-2680).

These are just a few examples of the diverse range of methods that can be applied to path planning for UAV obstacle avoidance. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the task, researchers may choose to explore one or more of these approaches or develop novel hybrid methods combining multiple techniques.
