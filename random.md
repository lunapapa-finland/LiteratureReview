GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System, which is a term used to describe a constellation of satellites that provide positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services on a global scale. GPS (Global Positioning System) is a specific GNSS system developed and operated by the United States government. Other examples of GNSS systems include GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (European Union), BeiDou (China), and NavIC (India).

GNSS can be used in Navigation, Surveying and mapping, Timing synchronization and Emergency services

GPS Denieled ENV: 
-The reliance on GPS for ship navigation and the potential challenges of operating in a GPS-denied environment are significant concerns in maritime operations. GPS signals are crucial for precise positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) on naval vessels. However, the vulnerability of GPS to interference, jamming, and spoofing poses a serious threat to maritime navigation. To mitigate this risk, there is a growing recognition of the need for alternative navigation technologies and a revival of traditional navigation methods like celestial and magnetic navigation. These old techniques, combined with new technologies such as magnetic anomaly navigation, can provide resilient and accurate positioning even in GPS-denied scenarios. The maritime industry is also exploring advanced positioning solutions like Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for precise navigation in challenging environments. Overall, the threat of GPS denial in ship navigation underscores the importance of diversifying navigation tools and training personnel in traditional navigation methods to ensure operational readiness in GPS-denied situations

    - Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) is the problem of using video input to reconstruct the 3D world and the path of the camera in an 'on-line' manner. Since the data is processed in real time, one does not have access to all of the data at once. (Contrast this with structure from motion (SFM), which is usually formulated as an 'off-line' process on all the data seen, and is not time dependent.) A VSLAM solution is useful for mobile robot navigation or as an assistant for humans exploring an unknown environment. https://www.osti.gov/biblio/961651

    - The use of GPS-denied drones in ship rescue operations is crucial for scenarios where GPS signals are unreliable or unavailable. GPS-denied drones are particularly valuable in environments like underground or metal structures where GPS signals cannot penetrate effectively.
