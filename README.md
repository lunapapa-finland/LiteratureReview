# Literature Review

In this repository, I will continually organize a comprehensive review of the existing literature pertinent to machine learning in the domains of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or autonomous ships.

## [Research Plan](./Research%20Plan.md)

This section will outline the objectives, methodologies, expected contributions, and timeline with milestones of our research endeavor.

## [Reviewed Papers](./Paper%20List.md)

This section will encompass a spectrum of academic papers, conference proceedings, and technical reports pertaining to machine learning in UAVs or ships. Encompassing topics like sensor fusion, object detection, path planning, and control algorithms, our synthesis of insights from these sources aims to discern trends, identify gaps, and pinpoint opportunities for further exploration.

## [Domain Knowledge](./DomainDetails.md)

This section will furnish background information concerning the fundamental concepts, technologies, and applications pertinent to UAVs or autonomous ships.
