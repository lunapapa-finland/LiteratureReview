-   The study of UAV obstacle avoidance problem mainly refers to the use of airborne sensors to obtain information about the environment in which the UAV is located, combin- ing path planning algorithms and flight control methods to guide the UAV to avoid static or dynamic obstacles so as to finally reach the target point safely and without errors.

-   In outdoor scenarios, the drone is often combined with GPS to obtain its location, but when it flies in a tight interior or cave, GPS cannot locate it accurately. In this context, how to make quadrotors have efficient obstacle avoidance capability, find the best flight path and reach the target safely has become a new research hotspot

-   Based on the principle of UAV obstacle avoidance technology, the UAV obstacle avoidance process can be divided into four stages: environ- ment perception, obstacle detection, path planning and flight control. 

-   When facing obstacles, the UAV first uses a series of sensors loaded to sense the environment and obtain the position of the body, then detects the orientation and distance information between the body and the obstacles; after that, it continuously searches for feasible obstacle avoidance paths according to the [path planning](./Path%20Planning.md) algorithm to obtain the optimal or sub-optimal obstacle avoidance paths; and finally com- bines the flight control method to control the UAV’s attitude transformation for obstacle avoidance and safely reaches the target point.
